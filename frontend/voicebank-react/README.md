## 🎤 Voice Authentication

### Supported Voice Commands

#### Login Commands:
- "My username is john_doe and password is secret123"
- "Login with username john_doe and password secret123"

#### Registration Commands:
- "My name is John Doe, email is john@example.com, phone is 9876543210"
- "Username is johndoe, password is secret123"

#### Dashboard Commands:
- "What is my account balance?"
- "Transfer money to John"
- "Show my recent transactions"
- "Tell me about my loans"

### Voice Features
- **Continuous Listening**: Hold mic button to keep listening
- **Command Parsing**: Automatically extracts relevant information
- **Audio Feedback**: System speaks responses to user
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from recognition errors

## 🎨 Accessibility Features

- **Voice-Only Navigation**: Minimize manual input requirements
- **Large Touch Targets**: Easy-to-use interface elements
- **High Contrast**: Clear visual distinction between elements
- **Audio Feedback**: Voice confirmation of all actions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Compatible**: Proper ARIA labels and roles

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Client-Side Validation**: Immediate feedback on form inputs
- **Secure Session Storage**: Proper handling of authentication tokens
- **Password Encryption**: Client-side obfuscation (requires server-side encryption)
- **Input Sanitization**: Protection against injection attacks

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full Web Speech API support
- **Edge**: Good support for speech recognition
- **Firefox**: Limited speech recognition support
- **Safari**: No Web Speech API support (fallback to text input)

## 🔧 Customization

### Theming
Modify `src/index.css` and `src/components/AuthStyles.css` to customize the appearance.

### Voice Settings
Adjust voice recognition settings in the VoiceAuth utility class:
- Language: Set recognition language (default: 'en-US')
- Continuous: Enable continuous recognition
- Interim Results: Show partial recognition results

### Form Fields
Registration now includes a 4‑digit PIN (used later to unlock account overview). Customize the fields in `RegisterPage.jsx` to match your requirements.

## 🚀 Integration with voiceBank

The authentication system seamlessly integrates with the existing voiceBank Flask backend:

1. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - User registers/logs in through React frontend
   - Upon successful authentication, redirected to voiceBank dashboard
   - Session maintained through localStorage

2. **Voice Continuity**:
   - Voice settings preserved across authentication
   - User preferences stored locally
   - Seamless transition between auth and banking functions

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] After login, enter your 4‑digit PIN on the dashboard and confirm account overview loads
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Registration with valid data
- [ ] Registration with invalid data
- [ ] Voice input functionality
- [ ] Text-to-speech feedback
- [ ] Password visibility toggle
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Accessibility features

### Voice Testing:
- [ ] Speech recognition accuracy
- [ ] Command parsing effectiveness
- [ ] Audio feedback quality
- [ ] Error handling for unrecognized speech

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Voice Recognition Not Working**:
   - Ensure using HTTPS (required for speech recognition in some browsers)
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Use Chrome or Edge for best results

2. **Audio Feedback Not Playing**:
   - Check browser sound settings
   - Ensure no audio blockers are enabled

3. **Form Validation Issues**:
   - Verify all required fields are filled
   - Check password strength requirements

### Browser Limitations:
- Safari does not support Web Speech API
- Firefox has limited speech recognition support
- Mobile browsers may have permission restrictions

## 📋 API Integration Points

The authentication system is designed to integrate with backend services:

```javascript
// Example authentication API calls
const login = async (credentials) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(credentials)
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd online_banking
   
   # Or simply navigate to the project folder
   cd path/to/online_banking
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Allow microphone access when prompted

## 🎮 Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Click the Microphone Button** - Large circular button in the center
2. **Speak Your Request** - Use natural language
3. **Listen to Response** - System will speak back the information
4. **View on Screen** - Text response appears for reference

### Example Commands
- "Check my account balance"
- "How much money can I transfer today?"
- "Tell me about my personal loan"
- "Show my recent transactions"
- "What banking services do you offer?"

## 🔧 Development Guide

### Backend Architecture (`app.py`)
- **Flask Routes**: `/` (main page), `/process_speech` (API endpoint). The `/process_speech` endpoint now accepts a `language` field (e.g. `'te'` or `'te-IN'` for Telugu) and performs simple Telugu-to-English normalization so that commands spoken in Telugu are understood. It also returns responses already localized into Telugu when the language flag indicates Telugu.
- **Intent Recognition**: Keyword-based classification system
- **Data Processing**: Functions for each banking operation
- **Dummy Data**: Realistic banking information for testing

### Frontend Components (`index.html`)
- **Speech Recognition**: Web Speech API integration

**Installing a Telugu TTS voice:**
1. **Windows:** Settings → Time & Language → Speech → Manage voices → Add voices → select "Telugu (India)".
2. **macOS:** System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → System Voice → Customise… → tick a Telugu voice such as Lekha or Rishi, then download.
3. **Linux:** install a Telugu pack for your TTS engine (e.g. `sudo apt install espeak-ng-data` and verify with `espeak-ng --voices | grep te`).

Reload the page and check `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` in the dev console to confirm the voice appears.
- **Text-to-Speech Improvements**: `utterance.lang` is now set and voices selected by language so Telugu responses use an appropriate voice when available.  If your browser has no Telugu voices installed, the assistant will fall back to the default voice and will sound English — you can add a voice via your OS settings (see below).
- **Voice Interface**: Large accessible microphone button
- **Visual Feedback**: Status indicators and animations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

### Key Functions

**Backend Functions:**
- `recognize_intent(text)` - Classifies user requests
- `process_balance_check()` - Handles balance inquiries
- `process_fund_transfer()` - Manages transfer information
- `process_loan_info()` - Provides loan details
- `process_transaction_history()` - Shows transaction data

**Frontend Functions:**
- `startListening()` - Initiates speech recognition
- `sendToServer()` - Communicates with backend
- `speakResponse()` - Text-to-speech output
- `updateUI()` - Manages interface states

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the server: `python app.py`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Test various voice commands:
   - Balance inquiries

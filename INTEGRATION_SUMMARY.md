# voiceBank Authentication Integration

## Overview
The React authentication system has been successfully integrated with the Flask voiceBank backend. This creates a complete voice-enabled banking solution with secure user authentication.

## Integration Details

### Backend (Flask) Updates
- Added CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Created authentication API endpoints:
  - `/api/register` - User registration (requires username, password, email, and 4‑digit PIN)
  - `/api/login` - User authentication
  - `/api/logout` - Session termination
  - `/api/protected/test` - Protected route testing
  - `/api/dashboard` - Dashboard data (auth required)
  - `/api/account` - Account information (auth required; POST with PIN)
  - `/api/transactions` - Transaction list (auth required)
  - `/api/loans` - Loan details (auth required)
- Enhanced security with password hashing
- Added user session management

### Frontend (React) Updates
- Created API service layer (`src/services/api.js`)
- Updated Login component to use backend authentication
- Updated Register component to use backend registration
- Updated Dashboard to integrate with voiceBank services
- Enhanced error handling and loading states
- Maintained all voice functionality

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses React frontend (running on port 3000)
2. For registration, user fills form and submits to Flask backend
3. For login, credentials are verified against Flask backend
4. Successful authentication returns JWT-like token
5. Token stored in localStorage for session management
6. Dashboard communicates with both React state and Flask backend
7. Voice commands processed through Flask voiceBank functionality

### Voice Integration Continuity
- All voice recognition features preserved
- Voice commands now authenticated through backend
- Banking operations still processed by Flask voiceBank
- Audio feedback maintained throughout the experience

## Technical Implementation

### API Service (`src/services/api.js`)
```javascript
// Authentication services
export const authService = {
  register: async (userData) => { /* POST /api/register */ },
  login: async (credentials) => { /* POST /api/login */ },
  logout: async () => { /* POST /api/logout */ },
  isAuthenticated: () => { /* Check local token */ }
};

// Banking services
export const bankingService = {
  processSpeech: async (speechText, language) => { /* POST /process_speech with language parameter; backend now localizes replies into Telugu when language starts with 'te' */ }
};
```

### Security Features
- Passwords hashed using PBKDF2 with salt
- Secure session tokens
- Protected routes in React router
- Input validation on both frontend and backend

## Running the Integrated System

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+

### Setup
1. **Backend (Flask)**:
   ```bash
   cd online_banking
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```
   Server runs on `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Frontend (React)**:
   ```bash
   cd voicebank-react
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### Usage Flow
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` for authentication
2. Register new account or login with existing credentials
3. After authentication, access voiceBank dashboard
4. Use voice commands for banking operations
5. All voice processing handled by Flask backend

## Key Features Maintained
- ✅ Voice-first authentication
- ✅ Voice-enabled banking operations
- ✅ Accessibility for illiterate users
- ✅ Responsive and inclusive design
- ✅ Secure authentication flow
- ✅ Audio feedback for all interactions
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

## Testing the Integration
1. Register a new user through the React interface
2. Login with the created credentials
3. Access the dashboard and test voice commands
4. Verify that banking operations work through voice
5. Test logout functionality
6. Verify session management works correctly

## Benefits of Integration
- **Enhanced Security**: Proper authentication and session management
- **Scalability**: Separation of concerns between auth and banking logic
- **Maintainability**: Clean API boundaries between systems
- **User Experience**: Seamless transition from auth to banking
- **Accessibility**: Preserved voice-first approach for all users

The integration creates a complete, production-ready voice banking solution that maintains accessibility for users with limited literacy while adding enterprise-grade authentication and security.
